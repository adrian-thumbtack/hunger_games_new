		<p><b>You, an idiot: What is this?</b></p>
		<p>Me: A totally normal Hunger Games simulator.</p>
		<p><b>No, like, actually, what is this?</b></p>
		<p>I just told you.</p>
		<p><b>Fine. What happened to the old one?</b></p>
		<p>The code was clunky and bad because this was made as a joke during class.</p>
		<p><b>And the content?</b></p>
		<p>For the most part, it's been ported over.</p>
		<p><b>Why are some of the jokes completely incomprehensible?</b></p>
		<p>Come on, you know you love them. Explaining alienating inside jokes makes it less fun.</p>
		<p><b>How can I contribute?</b></p>
		<p>Do stuff on Github or something, we can't stop you.</p>
		<p><b>"We?"</b></p>
		<p>It is beyond your comprehension.</p>
		<p><b>How do I know this site is good?</b></p>
		<p>Here are some testimonials from satisfied customers:</p>
		<b>
			<p><i>"(the weird one)"</i></p>
			<p><i>"wtf is this site bruh"</i></p>
			<p><i>"(*vibes in having no clue what this means.*)"</i></p>
			<p><i>"Oh that site"</i></p>
